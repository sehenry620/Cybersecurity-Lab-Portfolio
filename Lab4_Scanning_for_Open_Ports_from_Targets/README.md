# Lab 4 â€“ Scanning for Open Ports

## Objective
Identify open ports and running services on a target system using Nmap.

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Nmap

## Steps Overview
1. Perform a TCP SYN scan (`-sS`) on the target.
2. Use service detection (`-sV`) to identify running services.
3. Document findings for potential attack vectors.

## Key Learnings
- Port scanning techniques used in reconnaissance.
- How attackers enumerate services to plan further exploitation.
