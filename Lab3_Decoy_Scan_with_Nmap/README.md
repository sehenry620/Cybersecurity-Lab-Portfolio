# Lab 3 â€“ Nmap Decoy Scan

## Objective
Use Nmap's decoy feature to perform a stealth scan while obfuscating the attacker's IP.

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Nmap

## Steps Overview
1. Identify the target IP or subnet.
2. Run Nmap using the `-D` flag to generate decoy IPs.
3. Observe how the scan results are received while hiding the real attacker IP.

## Key Learnings
- How decoy scans can evade detection.
- The importance of IDS/IPS systems in identifying spoofed traffic.
